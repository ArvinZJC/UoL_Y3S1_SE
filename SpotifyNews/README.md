# SpotifyNews From the Project UoL_Y3S1_SE

In the `exe` branch, this project is named as **Spotify News** which can generate track recommendations from Spotify based on keywords extracted from that day's news pulled from [News API](https://newsapi.org/). In addition, it is a modifed version based on the version in the `master` branch so that it can contain an executable file generated by [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/PyInstaller/). It is developed by **Team 2** as Assessment 1 of the course **Software Engineering** during Semester 1 of Year 3 in UoL. It must be admitted that there are many things to optimise, such as the log format and the performance. However, since the major aim of the assessment is to better understand the Agile methodology SCRUM and to produce standard documentation, it does not really matter whether the application is perfect or not.

## About Team 2

## Partial UI

Except the executable file, the project in this branch should have the same functionality as that in the `master` branch. So please refer to that branch for these 2 parts.

## ATTENTION

1. You can type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` into the command prompt under the root directory of the project to simplify the pip installation. The requirements are different from the `master` branch.
2. The project uses [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) to build the UI framework. The command `pyside2-uic -x appMainWindow.ui -o appMainWindow.py` was used to convert the UI file to a PY file.
3. Before using the command `pyinstaller -F -w -n SpotifyNews -i resources/favicon.ico main.py` to generate an [executable file](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/tree/exe/SpotifyNews/Executable%20File), **PyInstaller 3.5 needs a modification** to avoid a compatibility issue according to [answers on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53058052/unable-to-find-c-nltk-data-while-creating-executable-using-pyinstaller). Please note that the executable file might not work perfectly, since it did not have a thorough test which was not the focus of the assessment.
4. Compared to the `master` branch, the project in this branch mainly has the following differences:

* Add the folder "resources" in [Newspaper3k](https://pypi.org/project/newspaper3k/) (package name: newspaper) to the root directory of the project and move the [icon file](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/tree/exe/SpotifyNews/resources) to the folder.
* Change the icon path from `'favicon.ico'` to `'resources\\favicon.ico'`. - [main.py](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/blob/exe/SpotifyNews/main.py)
* Copy the package "newspaper", rename it as "newspaper3k", and modify some files to avoid compatibility issues during the process of generating an executable file. - [settings.py](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/blob/exe/SpotifyNews/newspaper3k/settings.py) and [utils.py](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/blob/exe/SpotifyNews/newspaper3k/utils.py)
* Use `newspaper3k` instead of `newspaper`. - [keywordExtractor.py](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3S1_SE/blob/exe/SpotifyNews/keywordExtractor.py)
